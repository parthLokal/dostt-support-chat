module allowed to mutate either, so `ticket.status` can never drift from the
latest history row (enforced here in code, not a DB trigger, so the two
writes stay inside one Python transaction and one code path to review).

`create_ticket` does create -> auto-assign -> Slack-notify in a single
transaction, the same "services do cross-integration business logic, routes
and the agent never call integrations directly" shape as the AstroHelp
sibling project.

    ticket arriving from anywhere OTHER than a live Gemini chat turn (the
    in-app Help & Support form, a CS agent logging a call-in complaint, a
    future webhook). For the three refund-driven categories, if `call_id` is
    given, the rules run right here, synchronously, before the ticket is
    even written — triggered by this data landing in the table. The model
    is never handed the eligible/not-eligible outcome (product decision,
    2026-09-08 — see tool_schemas.py's comment): every refund-driven ticket
    is told to the account as "raised for review," whether or not it just
    silently auto-resolved a moment later.

    this ticket to the real Dostt backend (app/integrations/dostt_api_client.py)

    confirmed vs. still missing. This local Ticket row is always the ticket
    of record regardless; the real-API call is a best-effort mirror on top,
    never something its failure should block or roll back the local write for.
