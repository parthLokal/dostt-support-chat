"""The single choke point every tool call passes through.

SECURITY BOUNDARY: account_id is unconditionally stripped from whatever the
model supplied (tool_schemas.py gives it no schema slot to supply one in the
first place, but this holds even if it tried anyway) and replaced with the
authenticated session's real id, before any handler (and therefore any
service/integration) ever sees it. This holds even under prompt injection —
e.g. a malicious ticket description telling the model to emit a different
account_id renders inert here, because the value is never read, only
overwritten.

This is also the only file in app/agent/ that imports app.services /
app.integrations (transitively, via app.agent.tool_registry) — the
orchestrator itself only ever imports app.agent.tool_schemas (pure data).
